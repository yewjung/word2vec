       My first impression about GMAIL   1) Ultra fast login, I’m using it from India. As compare to  urlLink mail.yahoo.co.in  or MSN.  2) Short cut keys, take me to good olden days of UNIX (hey now Linux or FreeBSD). If you see list of short cut keys they almost match to old UNIX/Linux VI command.   3) Labels – new way to arrange the stuff.   4) User interface is simple [ it is cool :-) ]

       What the hell GMAIL is?  Google's mail service (right now it’s webmail)   Why to use it?  See  urlLink GMAIL Getting started guide     What are my personal choices to use it?   1) Service offered by Google, it means it will be as fast as google search engine  2) 1 GB mail space (1000MB)  3) Other host of features such mentioned in above url.   Gmail home page/gmail page?   See gmail at  urlLink here  or  urlLink here  .   Interested in gmail?   1) Visit  urlLink this  site.  2) If you have  urlLink blogger.com  account or any other google account, then google (company) it self might give you chance to test it. Please not GMAIL is in betat stage and not open to every one at the movement.

       Existing user can now invite the friends to use Gmail beta :-))   1) Login to GMAIL  2) Select (cilck) Inbox > Invite friend   3) Fill up friend details and existing email id  Unfortunately it works for only one user and GMAIL gives you only one chance. :-(

      Many users are reporting wrong mailbox size. Or some claims that GMAIL is giving 1TB mailbox size. Many stories running across web, personally my mailbox quota still indicates 1000MB.  See original story at  urlLink zdent  and at  urlLink slashdot.org .

      Recently I had noticed some funny advertisement (text-ad) of GMAIL service. Following one was really funny. In this I received the mail from GMAIL TEAM (support). In past I had mail them that GMAIL was working quite slow. They replayed me back. While reading mail I saw these advertisements related to babysitter and child care.     urlLink    Gmail funny advertisements (Click image to enlarge)

       Gmail got pretty good upload speed (big attachment)   1st attachment 5 mb mp3  2nd attachment 6 mb mp3  I was using DSL 512 shared with at least 50+ computers. Impressive.  Probably gmail is in beta and numbers of users are less that could be one of the causes for such speed.

      Gmail Spam technology is the best I had seen ever! It automatically deletes virus mail (send as attachment), block html and image based tracking in email, Spam filtering works up to 60% as compare to yahoo (no way to talk about hotmail here…) !  Previously I used to get around 100 spam mail everyday as I switched to gmail this is reduced by 60% (remember gmail is kid still aka beta service)
